## A Brief History of Virtualization


### Hardware Centric Development


In the beginning of the IT revolution, applications were deployed directly on the hardware.  All of the applications that lived on that hardware were on the same OS. As a result, all of the applications shared the same namespace.  This meant that each application had a single user space, and all shared the same runtime environment.  Applications were hardware-centric, had long maintenance cycles, and gave developers very little flexibility.
